## About
Graph of covid cases and deaths due to COVID-19 in 2020. To generate the graph just paste the code in Rstudio and execute it, the graph will be generated automatically.

This is why R is used majorly in the field of statistics for data visualization and data analytics with Python. 

To generate different graphs just download any csv file and paste the name of the csv in the code and 
make sure to place the file in the same directory with these R scripts, also make some small changes in the code then execute it.
